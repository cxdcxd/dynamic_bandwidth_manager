dynamic_bandwidth_manager
======

Communication is an important component in robotic systems. The appli-cation goals such as, finding a victim or teleoperate a robot in an obstacle avoid-ing application, may get affected if there are problems in communication between system agents. The developed package, dynamic_bandwidth_manager (DBM), was designed to maximize bandwidth usage in multi-robot systems. DBM controls the rate that a node publishes a topic, managing different channels where commands, sensory data and video frames are exchanged.
